- Checkers is a diagonal-moving game with two teams that have a goal of being the last player standing.


- You're only allowed to move towards the opposite side of the board.

- You can capture the opposing teams pieces by jumping over them but ONLY if that very next space is open & available. (As you can see the white piece is jumping over the black piece below)

Once a piece makes it across, then that piece will become a "King" (You can have more than one king, once the second black piece moves to the end of the board then that too will become a king piece.)

"Kings" are not limited to moving in only one direction, they can move both forward & back but still only allowed one space at a time.


The team with no more pieces loses.
