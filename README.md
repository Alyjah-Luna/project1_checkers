# project1_checkers


Checkers is a diagonal-moving game with two teams that have a goal of being the last player standing.


You're only allowed to move towards the opposite side of the board. 


You can capture the opposing teams pieces by jumping over them but ONLY if that very next space is open & available.


Once a piece makes it across, then that piece will become a "King" (You can have more than one king)


"Kings" are not limited to moving in only one direction, they can move both forward & back but still only allowed one space at a time.


The team with no more pieces loses.
